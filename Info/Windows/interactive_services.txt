"Interacting with the User from a Service with Terminal Services

All services run in Terminal Services session 0. Therefore, if an 
interactive service displays a user interface, it is only visible to the 
user who connected to session 0. Because there is no way to guarantee 
that the interactive user is connected to session 0, do not configure 
a service to run as an interactive service on Terminal Services or 
Windows XP (fast user switching is implemented using Terminal Services).

If a service running on a multiuser system must interact with a user, 
the service should create a separate GUI application running within the 
context of the interactive user. The easiest way to run an application 
in each session is to add it to the following key: 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run. 
This GUI application should be designed to communicate with the service 
through some method of IPC, for example, named pipes, as described in 
the previous section. 
By using named pipes, the server can distinguish between multiple user 
processes by giving each pipe a unique name based on the session ID."
