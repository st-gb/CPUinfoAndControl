cygwin under Windows
 -"make makefile.gcc"/ "gnuwin32-make makefile.gcc" didn't work
 -1. download wxWidgets for WIndows, run setup
 -1.1 Ensure that there are NO spaces in the dir pathes!
 -2. inside the WIndows-Shell, start the Unix-Shell "sh"
 -2.1 run the script ">>wxwidgets-dir<</configure ..."
 -2.2 executing "make" failed at ">>wxwidgets-dir<</utils/wxrc" if I recall correctly
 -avoid pathes with spaces (g++ has problems then)
 -context menu on Project 
  ->context menu entry "properties"
   ->Build
    ->C++ Compiler
     ->Include Directories: Add
      - >>WinRing-dir<</source/dll
      - >>wxWidgets-dir<</include
      [ - >>Platform SDK dir<</Include ]
      [ - >>MSVisual Studio dir<</VC/include ]
      [  - delete or rename the standard IO files like "iostream" from this dir
         because the ones from cygwin should be taken! 
         ]
   -Linker: 
 -there should be no (visible) UNNECESSARY ".cpp" (e.g. "thrimpl.cpp") files be added to 
   the project NetBeans: else NetBeans tries to compile them with compile errors (
   there are missing include insode the cpp files: 
   the needed includes are within other (header) files)
 -add include directories
  -caution: there must be no spaces in path name
  -for WinRing0 (>>winring-dir<</source/dll)
 -add preprocessor definitions:
   -"NOMINMAX" 
     because of errors in std::min(...) and std::max(...) in <bits/stl_algobase.h>:
   -"_DEBUG" for/if linking to DEBUG libraries
     else an error when starting the created ".exe" that the exe is linked to non-debug
     but the libs are debug.
   -__WXMSW__
   -__GNUWIN32__ for include/wx/string.h: to avoid the error
      "#error  "Please define string case-insensitive compare for your OS/compiler" "
      in function "inline int Stricmp(const char *psz1, const char *psz2)"
 -add needed (import) libraries
  -especially if the linker says "undefined reference to ..."
	  -search for the string within the lib dirs of cywin etc. e.g. 
	   via the Windows explorer to find the lib file for it
  -maybe google for the undefined function or etc. name in order to find
   the appropriate lib name to import
  -the ORDER of the libraries DOES MATTER:
   -the order that worked for ME (these are Debug libraries: the have a "d" inside the name):
     (NetBeans: button "Add Library...")
	   -1. wx_msw[d]_core[...]
	   -2. wx_based (for wxThread, ...)
	   -3. wx_mswd_adv-2.8
	   -4. wxexpatd-2.8
	   -5. libcomdlg32.a
	   -6. libgdi32.a
	   -7. libcomctl32.a
	   -8. libole32.a (CoCreateInstance)
	   -9. libuuid.a (_IID_PersistFile)
	   -10.liboleaut32.a
	   -11.libkernel32.a (for "::Sleep(DWORD)" )
  -for Windows API:
   -from path ">>cygwin-dir<</lib/w32api"
  -for wxWidgets:
   -">>wxWidgets-dir<</lib
 -I copied setup.h from 
   >>wxWidgets-dir<</lib/wx/include/msw-ansi-debug-static-2.8/wx 
   to
   >>wxWidgets-dir<</include/wx
   because ">>wxWidgets-dir<</lib/wx/include/msw-ansi-debug-static-2.8/wx" was in the
   include pathes but the setup.h was noct found though!
