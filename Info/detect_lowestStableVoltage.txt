detect lowest stable CPU core voltage:
======================================
Seems to work with Prime95's "in-place large FFTs" test best.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm :
"An in-place algorithm updates its input sequence only through replacement or swapping of elements."

So do it the same way?
