"have just experienced the same problem with the ARM tools. Turning off Norman anti virus fixed the problem, re-launching it immediately re-created the problem. "

"I had the same problem in Micro$oft Windows Vista Sad - I deactivated defender and that stupid things and It worked again. " 

"just encountered this error from cygwin and this thread was helpful - the tips regarding Panda Antivirus.

I turned off under unknown threats tab...
TruPrevent-Blocking of unknown threats...
Settings...
Behavioural analysis based on artificial intelligence...
UNCHECK - Enable behavioral analysis

This resolved the issue for me and I didn't have to disable anything else."

"Well .. after second run of nmake, the darned heap error re-appeared, with windows defender and virusshield completely off.

Solution? Run the compile environment in Win XP SP2 compatibility mode (Shortcut properties->Compatibility Tab->Use compatibility->WinXP SP2) and everything works sight and sound!

Googling for "Couldn't reserve space for cygwin's heap" brings up quite a lot of stuff, and there are several references to problems with other anti-virus programs."
