<body><h1>History</h1><br>In the begining of October 2008 I got my tx2550eg.
Shortly after I began to measure the power because of my interest. When
I saw that the AMD CPU consumed very much of electrical power I was
interested in which power savings are possible.<br><br>But I couldn't find
any Griffin undervolting application. I didn't want to wait until there
is such a tool for Griffin and developed it myself.<br><br>At first I
used a Ubuntu 8.04 live CD and took source code of a Linux undervolting
program and adapted it. So the first (as far as I know;&nbsp;there may
be others that did it before me and didn't make it public) Griffin
undervolting happened on Linux.<br>Because the laptop freezed when
writing via the COFVID control register (that I think is intended to
change voltage-frequency operating points) too often I had the idea to
simply patch the p-state registers (nowadays this approach is used by a
lot of tools).<br><br>The source code of the Linux&nbsp;undervolting
program was written in C and because I avoid using C where possible I
decided to completely rewrite it in &nbsp;C++ under Windows (this was
possible because I found the WinRing0 library). This first Windows
version came on 27th October 2008 or even before.<br><br>Then I tried
to undervolt the Northbridge. This was not very easy because I had to
understand the documentation nomenclature and so it took me some days
(well, that may be another evidence for my copyist speculation). On
November 6th 2008 or even before I got the Northbridge undervolting
working under Windows (and before Windows I got it working under
Linux). But the saving was just about 0.5 W so there is no real need
for it.<br><br>The initial name of the tool was "PumaStateCtrl" because
it was intended to possibly also undervolt the graphics chip. Also, I
found the name funny because if you only take the 1st letter of
"PumaStateCtrl" you have the word "PStateCtrl" and p-state is the
abbreviation for the CPU core performance state.<br>At first this
software was just for exactly 1 CPU model: Turion Ultra X2 ZM-82 (2200
MHz), but before publishing/ announcing the software I decided to add
support for other ZM-CPUs. Then a member of tabletpcreview.com informed
me that the RM models are similar and yes I checked that they are from
the same CPU family then and included support for the whole family 17
as this was hard no more because of the relationship to the ZMs. <br>But
the support for the Radeon HD is dropped because it is not documented
very well by AMD/ATi and I do not want to waste my time with it. And so
now I do not want to have the platform name inside the program
name&ndash;this would be misleading.<br></body></html>
