how to build wxPumaStateCtrlDlg:

http://www.wxwidgets.org/docs/faqgtk.htm#static:
"Can I statically link the GTK+ library?
No, this is not possible. It leads to crashes in GTK+."

under Linux (tested with Ubuntu 8.10 32 bit)
 -1. download package "wx2.8-headers", libwxbase2.8-dev (for "wx/setup.h")
 -2. add "/usr/include/wx-2.8" to include path
 -define preprocessor macro 
   "__WXGTK20__": so the compiler searches in folder "/usr/include/wx-2.8/wx/gtk" when
   __WXGTK__ for GdkCursor in "defs.h"
  in "/usr/include/wx-2.8/wx/app.h"
 -in sourcecode: include "/usr/lib/[...]/wx/setup.h before "wx/app.h"
   -setup.h anpassen: wx_USE_IMAGE etc. auf 1
 -install package "libwxgtk2.8-0" and/ or "libwxgtk2.8-dev" in order to link to the wxwidgets code
